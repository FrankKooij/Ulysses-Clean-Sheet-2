Ulysses III: *Dirty sheets?*

Sometimes, after copying from web-pages and pasting with Ulysses excellent "Paste from Rich Text", you get too few or too many blank lines. This script cleans up the mess, test it out!

Does not change your original sheet, just puts a cleaned copy in the Inbox (iCloud)

Drag sheet to folder on Desktop, python script fixes blank lines and spaces,  
and deliver **Clean sheet back in Inbox.**

Use Hazel for smooth laundry service :)
